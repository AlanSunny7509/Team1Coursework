# Sprint 1 Backlog

Our intial Sprint 1 plan:
1) As a researcher, I can create a questionnaire that I can send to participants so that I can collect responses 
2) As a researcher, I can create questions that are drop-down selections to allow restriction in answers 

This sprint backlog evolved as our requirements changed, especially while the team became more cohesive (as can be seen by the Tuckman model)
