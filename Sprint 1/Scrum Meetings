### Summary of Conversation:
We went through SCRUM requirements for the coursework (such as the video recording).
Then we talked about our plans for the day in a stand-up setting, going around the group and giving time for each person to speak.
We updated the 'Sprint 1 Backlog: To do / In Progress / Completed' project in the GitHub repository to reflect that we had chosen user stories #1 and #2, by moving these to the 'In Progress' column.
We then acknowledged any potential blockages.

## Day 2 - Scrum Meeting summary
The Scrum Master for this meeting was Joshua Bradley

### Members Present:
Josh, James S, James R, Luke, Harry, Jesse, Alan

### Members Not Present:


### Summary of Conversation:
We first talked about how during the previous afternoon, the team was bottlenecked adn struggled to work simultaneously. To combat this, we decided tasks should not be split into such small jobs, and we also looked for other user stories to work on from the Sprint 1 Backlog - deciding on #4, #17, and #18.
Then we talked about our plans for the day in a stand-up setting, going around the group and giving time for each person to speak.
We updated the 'Sprint 1 Backlog: To do / In Progress / Completed' project in the GitHub repository, to show #4, #17, and #18 to be in progress. These tasks were assigned to Alan, James R and Harry.
We then acknowledged any potential blockages. A major one that we found yesterday morning was a limited wireframe software development application. Josh, being the scrum master, was tasked to find a better alternative - soon finding a free 'professional/educational' version of the same application which was not limited and free for students.

## Day 3 - Scrum Meeting summary
The Scrum Master for this meeting was Joshua Bradley

### Members Present:
Josh, James S, James R, Luke, Harry, Jesse, Alan

### Members Not Present:


### Summary of Conversation:
We went through what we achieved the previous day which included: setting up an ethics form, setting up local databases with WAMP fo testing purposes, pair programming, and design changes.
Then we discussed our plans for the day which involved finalising the ethics form, continuing with general PHP development.
Luke brought up an issue about different relationship types within our ER diagram (and thus database). Harry took the lead in solving this quickly.
We quickly reviewed agile methods to ensure we stayed on track.
